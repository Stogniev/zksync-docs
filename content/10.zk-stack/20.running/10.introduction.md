title: Intro to Running a Chain
description: Get started with running a ZK Chain
---

There are several phases for chain operators before launching a ZK chain on mainnet.

The entire process from start to mainnet launch looks like this:

## 1. Get to know the ZK Stack

The first phase is getting to know the ZK Stack by running a local devnet.

1. Go through the [quickstart](./quickstart) and [custom ZK chain tutorial](https://code.zksync.io/tutorials/custom-zk-chain).
1. Familiarize yourself with the [`zksync-era`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era) repository, [its documentation](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/)
    and [the zkstack tool](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/main/zkstack_cli).
    The `zksync-era` repo is the main orchestrator of the ZK Stack.
1. Understand the various [components](/zk-stack/components), or services, running.
1. Explore [Grafana dashboards](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-observability) and metrics to see how your chain is behaving in real time.
1. Explore the [server codebase](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/architecture.html).

## 2. Launch a Private Devnet

Launching a testnet gets you closer to a real public environment, and will remain your private devnet.

1. [Deploy](/zk-stack/running/production#deploying-to-a-non-local-environment) to a persistent environment (e.g., cloud VM or dedicated server).
1. Spin up Grafana with [the public dashboards](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-observability).

## 3. Launch a Public Testnet

Your public testnet should be identical to your mainnet, but settled on Sepolia.

1. Establish a [backup](/zk-stack/running/production#database-backup) strategy for your PostgreSQL database.
1. Setup a [block explorer](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer).
1. Setup a [bridging portal](https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal) for withdrawals and deposits.
1. Transition each component into its own container (State Keeper, API server, ETH Sender, etc.).
1. Move to a container orchestration system (eg. Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Openshift).
1. Create a new chain registered on the Sepolia Shared Bridge once you have a stable setup.
    Performing this step requires assistance from Matter Labs as this is a permissioned operation.
1. Ensure all the configurations make sense to you and your chain.
1. Try running an [external node](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/external-node/00_quick_start.html).

## 4. Add Provers

1. Add a single [Prover](/zk-stack/running/proving#running-the-prover) instance.
1. [Scale](/zk-stack/running/proving#scaling-your-prover) your prover setup.
1. [Monitor](/zk-stack/running/proving#prover-monitoring) proof-related metrics and logs in Grafana, and validate that multiple provers work concurrently.

## 5. Setup Monitoring and Alerting

1. Set up robust [monitoring](/zk-stack/running/production#monitoring) and alerting for infrastructure health.
2. Plan on setting up a 24/7 on-call rotation for production-level alerts.

## 6. Verify Your Readiness

1. You should also perform load tests to prove temporary spikes in usage will not result in resource exhaustion.
1. Familiarize yourself with [common procedures](/zk-stack/running/production#common-procedures).
1. Harden your [security](/zk-stack/running/production#security).

## 7. Register and Stabilize Your Mainnet

1. Create a non-public environment with the shared ecosystem on Ethereum Mainnet.
    Repeat the steps from the prod-grade testnet for your mainnet, based on the Elastic Network shared ecosystem on Ethereum mainnet.
    Keep it private or access-controlled initially while you validate.

## 8. Mainnet Launch and Public Availability

1. Coordinate the launch with Matter Labs.
2. Your chain is now live on mainnet! ðŸš€ðŸŒ”

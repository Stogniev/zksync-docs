[The Block Explorer](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer) ***TBD ADI Link**
It is a tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into all activities occurring on the ADI Network.
This tool is especially useful for users and developers who need to monitor or interact with the blockchain. Block Explorer consists of three main components:

- **Block Explorer App:**
  This is the user interface that enables users and developers to navigate and examine transactions,
  blocks, batches, contracts, tokens, and other elements within the ADI Network.

- **Block Explorer API:**
  This component provides an HTTP API for accessing structured data from the ADI Network.
  It retrieves data from the database maintained by the Block Explorer Worker.

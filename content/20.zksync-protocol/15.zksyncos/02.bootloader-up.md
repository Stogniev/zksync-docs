title: Bootloader
description: Learn about Bootloader, the entry point of the system
---

The bootloader is the component responsible for implementing the general blockchain protocol. Roughly, this means:

1. Initializing the system.
2. Reading the block context from the oracle.
3. Reading and parsing the first transaction.
4. Validating the transaction.
5. Executing the transaction.
6. Saving the transaction result.
7. Repeat from 3 until there are no more transactions.
8. Finalizing the block.

### Configuration

The bootloader can be configured with the following parameters
(found in the [`BasicBootloaderExecutionConfig`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zk_ee/blob/main/basic_bootloader/src/bootloader/config.rs) **TBD ADI Github Link** struct):

- `ONLY_SIMULATE`: skips the [validation](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/tx-processing#validation) **TBD ADI Link** step
when processing a transaction. Used for call simulation in the node.
- `IS_PROVING_ENVIRONMENT`: to skip some checks during sequencing.
- `SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND`: the range of addresses (starting from 0) where system contracts can be deployed.
- `AA_ENABLED`: whether native account abstraction is enabled.

In addition, the `basic_bootloader` crate has the following compilation flags:

- `code_in_kernel_space`: to enable normal contract execution for addresses in the range `[0, SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND]`.
- `transfers_to_kernel_space`: to enable token transfers to addresses in the range `[0, SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND]`. Note: the bootloader itself
has a special formal address (0x8001) that is always allowed to receive token transfers. This is used to collect fees.
- `charge_priority_fee`: to enable charging for the EIP-1559 tip (priority fee) on top of the base fee.
- `evm-compatibility`: enables all the previous flags, needed for the EVM test suite.

### Code Execution

For transaction execution, the bootloader has to execute some contract code. This contract code corresponds to one of the
supported VMs, and is executed through the
[Execution Environment (EE)](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/execution-environment) **TBD ADI Link** module.

A contract call is executed through an interplay between the bootloader and (potentially different) execution environments. Indeed, a contract
executing in a given EE can call to contracts that run on a different EE or to
a [System Hook](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/system-hooks) **TBD ADI Link**. This interplay is described
under [Runner Flow](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/runner-flow) **TBD ADI Link**.

### Block Header

At the end of the execution, the bootloader outputs the block header.

For the block header, the Ethereum format will be used. However, some fields will be set differently in the initial version for simplification.

The block header should fully determine the block, i.e., include all the necessary inputs to execute the block.
